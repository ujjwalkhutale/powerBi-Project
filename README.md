Dairy Sales Analysis Project

Project Overview
  This project dives into the sales data of a dairy business to uncover patterns and insights that can help make better decisions. Using Power BI, we built an interactive dashboard that tells the story behind the numbers—like which products sell the best, when sales peak, and where opportunities for growth lie.The idea was to turn raw data into something actionable, visually appealing, and easy to understand for anyone looking to optimize sales and performance.

Why This Project?

  The dairy industry is all about understanding customer preferences and staying ahead of trends. With this project, we wanted to bring clarity to questions like:

Which products are driving the most revenue?
Are there seasonal patterns in sales?
How does sales performance vary across regions?
By answering these questions, businesses can focus on what works and improve what doesn’t.

What We Did?


Data Cleaning and Transformation: The raw dataset was messy, so we cleaned it up to make it analysis-ready.
Built Dynamic Dashboards: Interactive visuals that let users explore data by time, product, region, and more.
Uncovered Insights: Found trends, identified best-selling products, and highlighted growth opportunities.

Tools Used

Power BI: For creating the dashboards and visuals.
Excel: For initial data exploration and cleaning.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): To calculate custom metrics like total sales, growth rates, and product performance.
